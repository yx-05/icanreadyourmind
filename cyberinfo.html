            <h3>Before you read this article, I want to tell you that you've just been tracked. I'm not reading your mind. 
                I'm just tracking your location via your IP address. If you luckily found that there's an error at the results,
                it's just because your are using VPN or the API that I use to track client's location has came to its limit.
                If you've been tracked accurately, haha, don't worry, I've had prepared some tips for you to prevent this 
                tracking and how to protect yourself online.</h3>

            <h2>Use a vpn while browsing the web to prevent the tracking</h2>
            <p>A virtual private network (VPN) gives you online privacy and anonymity by creating a private network from a 
            public internet connection. VPNs mask your internet protocol (IP) address so your online actions are virtually 
            untraceable. Most important, VPN services establish secure and encrypted connections to provide greater privacy 
            than even a secured Wi-Fi hotspot.</p>

            <h2>Make sure your devices are always up to date</h2>
            <p>If you don’t have security software, web browsers, and devices set to update automatically, turn on those 
            automatic updates now. Updates often include critical fixes for any security holes that may have been detected in 
            your programs or devices.</p>

            <h2>Don’t click on strange-looking links</h2>
            <p>Viruses and other forms of malware often spread because you click on a link from someone you know. If you 
            receive a link that looks strange and weird (for instance, it may have typos in it) from a trusted friend or family member, 
            contact them to ask if the link you’ve received was sent on purpose. You may also copy and paste the link into a 
            reputable link checker. Remember: Don’t click on the link.</p>

            <h2>Avoid using unsecured public Wi-Fi</h2>
            <p>If possible, try to avoid accessing unsecured public Wi-Fi on your devices. Using it can make you vulnerable to 
            predatory practices. And if you must use it, avoid entering compromising information, like your Social Security number 
            or financial information, on any websites. Better yet, use a VPN, or virtual private network, to do your browsing when 
            you’re not at home. This will encrypt the data you send and receive, making it much harder to intercept.</p>

            <h2>Avoid sharing personal information</h2>
            <p>It’s easy to get comfortable with sharing a little too much personal information online. But you may be surprised at 
            how much damage cybercriminals can do with just a little bit of information. To keep it safe, never share identifying 
            details, like your full name, address, or financial information with strangers you meet online. You should also be careful 
            about the usernames you create for websites — there’s no need for them to include your real name.</p>
